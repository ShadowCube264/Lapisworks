1.5.6.9
- Fixed requiring Hexical or it'll break the book :sob:
1.5.7

- Decreased the cost of Enchantments to 32 Amel.

- Added the Geode Dowser
  - Imbue 5 Amel into a compass
  - Consumes 1 amethyst dust per use
- Added the Simple Impetus
  - Infuse a Simple Mind into an empty Impetus

- Imbue Mind can now imbue into entities
  - this has potential
  - currently it can be imbued into flayed villagers, which, when they get a j\*b, immediately
    become level 2 or 3 (50/50)

1.5.8
- Hierophantics interop
  - Flaying "talented" into other villagers or vice versa works now
  - Max experience fishermen villagers can be flayed into you
    costs 64 amel and 10 charged amethyst
    they only have the on_my_reference_found trigger, triggers when your reference is found in a stack of an
    offender within "range"
      starts with a "guess" vector pointing from you to the enemy
    has a "vigilance" attribute which can range from 0-3
      0: no notification
      1: chat notification
      2: chat + audio notification
      3: chat + on-screen + audio notification
    they also have a "range" attribute (0-256)
      the higher, the more inaccurate the guess (err_margin=range/4)
      e.g. range=64 means guess can be 16 blocks from the offender
      or range=256 means guess can be 64 blocks from the offender
      however, if the offender is in your ambit the guess is always precise
  - Less than max experience fishermen can also be flayed into you
    costs 48 amel and 10 charged amethyst
    they are almost equivalent to the other mind
    err=range/8 by default, err=range/32 when offender is within ambit
    range is only 0-96
    starts casting with an entity reference to the offender on the stack
    has a 1 in err chance of not detecting the offender
